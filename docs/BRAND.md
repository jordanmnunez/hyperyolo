# hyperyolo Brand Guide

## The One-Liner

**hyperyolo**: A cobbled execution unit. Strap the rockets together. Fan the flames. Built to be an OSHA violation.

## Core Identity

### What We Are

hyperyolo wraps competing AI CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) into a single interface. We don't build AI — we strap existing rockets to the same frame and point them at your problem.

The underlying CLIs are already powerful. hyperyolo is the **mounting bracket** and the **accelerant**.

### The Aesthetic: Terminalcore Maximalism

- **Contained instability** — powerful forces held in check, barely
- **Steered chaos** — not random, but not safe either
- **Industrial strength** — this isn't fragile, it's overpowered

We're an OSHA violation not because we're poorly built, but because we removed the guardrails on purpose.

## Voice & Tone

### We Sound Like

A confident engineer who knows exactly how dangerous this is and hit run anyway. Direct. Slightly unhinged. Not performing.

### We Don't Sound Like

- A carnival barker (no snake oil salesman theatrics)
- Self-deprecating ("lol this might break")
- Corporate ("leveraging synergies")
- Tryhard edgy (no excessive skull emojis)

### Example Copy

| Context | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Tagline | "Built to be an OSHA violation." |
| Execution | "Rockets strapped. Flames fanned. Let it burn." |
| Success | "Clean burn. No explosions. This time." |
| Error | "ENGINE FAILURE. One of your rockets disagreed." |
| Onboarding | "You're about to strap three competing AI engines together. No guardrails. Good luck." |

## Visual Language

### The OSHA Palette

Colors derived from ANSI Z535 safety signage. We use regulatory warning colors for UI elements — the interface should feel like operating heavy machinery.

| Color | Hex | Meaning | Use |
|-------|-----|---------|-----|
| Danger Red | `#FF0000` | Immediate hazard | Execute/run actions |
| Warning Orange | `#FF4500` | Caution, active process | AI modules active |
| Caution Yellow | `#FFFF00` | Attention required | Warnings, disclaimers |
| Safety Green | `#00FF00` | Safe/recovery | Success states, resume |
| Notice Blue | `#0000FF` | Information | Links, docs |
| Void Black | `#000000` | Terminal background | Primary background |
| Phosphor White | `#F0F0F0` | High contrast text | Primary text |

### Typography

- **Primary**: System monospace (Menlo, Monaco, Courier New)
- **Brand mark**: Lowercase, tight tracking — `hyperyolo`
- **Signal words**: ALL CAPS for warnings — `WARNING`, `DANGER`, `CAUTION`

### Terminal Aesthetic

- Bold colors, high contrast
- ASCII art for branding moments
- No gradients, no rounded corners
- Visible grid structure
- Raw, unstyled where possible

## Key Metaphors

### Rockets, Not Duct Tape

We're not held together with tape and prayers. We're **multiple rocket engines bolted to the same frame**. Different manufacturers. Competing designs. Pointed in the same direction.

The instability isn't from poor construction — it's from combining powerful forces that weren't designed to work together.

### Fanning Flames

hyperyolo doesn't start fires. The underlying CLIs are already burning. We add oxygen. We fan the flames. We're the accelerant, not the spark.

### The Cobbled Execution Unit

"Cobbled" like cobblestone — assembled from individual pieces with visible joints. Not fragile. Not hidden. Honest about what it is. Built to last, built weird.

---

## What We Reject

- **Polished SaaS aesthetic** — no friendly gradients hiding complexity
- **False safety** — we don't pretend this is safe
- **Over-explanation** — the terminal doesn't hold your hand
- **Ironic detachment** — we're not joking, this actually works

---

## The Promise

You're strapping together the most powerful AI coding tools available. There are no guardrails. No approval workflows. No "are you sure?" dialogs.

hyperyolo gives you the mounting bracket and fans the flames.

What you build with it is on you.
